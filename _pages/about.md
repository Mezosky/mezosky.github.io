Hello, my name is Ignacio A. M. De la Jara!

I am a computer scientist from the University of Chile and I like to train neural networks 🦉. I currently live in Santiago de Chile, but I am packing my bags 🧳 to head to Australia to pursue a PhD in computer vision and mathematics.

I have a strong interest in teaching and democratizing knowledge of complex things. That's the purpose of this blog, to land according to my point of view certain papers I read and to let you know me a little bit more !

I have worked as a data scientist at [BCI](https://www.bci.cl/) and currently serve as a part-time professor for [MDS7202](https://github.com/MDS7202/MDS7202) at the University of Chile.
